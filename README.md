# udacity-business-analytics-nanodegree

This repository showcases the projects I completed for the Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree program. Each project allowed me to gain hands-on experience and sharpen my skills in various data analysis tools. Here's an overview of the projects you'll find here:

## Project 1: Interpret a Data Visualization

For this project, I dove into Tableau and used a premade dashboard, "Malaria Deaths in Africa: 2000-2014." I recorded three insightful observations using the data to practice interpreting data visualizations and effectively communicating my findings to others.

## Project 2: Analyze NYSE Data

In this project, I utilized data from the New York Stock Exchange to complete three tasks:

1. Conducted data analysis and created an engaging presentation to share my discoveries.
2. Developed a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement.
3. Created a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.
   
I leveraged Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint to bring this project to life.

## Project 3: Query a Music Store Database

This project challenged me to work with a music store database and demonstrate my mastery of SQL concepts. I formulated four questions that required explicit joins and aggregations in my SQL queries. I then transformed the query results into visualizations using SQL, Excel, and PowerPoint.

## Project 4: Build a Data Visualization Project

For this project, I harnessed the power of Tableau to create captivating visualizations using the US Census Demographic Data. I crafted three visualizations, including an interactive dashboard, and provided written summaries for each. This project showcased my ability to extract insights and communicate them effectively through data visualizations.
